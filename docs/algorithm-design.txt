Early attempts at creating algorithms to perform automated matching

----1----

1. Create a dictionary of variable names that are commonly used across all the data sources. 
This dictionary can serve as a reference for standardizing the variable names.

2. Iterate over each dataset and for each variable name, check if it exists in the reference dictionary. 
If it does not, try to match it to a similar variable name in the reference dictionary using fuzzy matching techniques, 
such as Levenshtein distance or Jaro-Winkler distance.

3. Once you have standardized the variable names across all the data sources, 
you can merge the datasets using a unique identifier such as the company name or the year of the data.

4. Finally, you can use a library such as Pandas to create an Excel file containing the merged data.

One way to approach this problem is to first create a mapping between the different names of the same thing. 
For example, if one data source refers to "carbon emissions" and another refers to "CO2 output", 
you can create a mapping that links these two terms together.

Once you have this mapping, you can use it to create a standardized set of names for the various data points. 
You can then use these standardized names to combine the data from multiple sources into a single dataset.

To do this, you can use Python libraries such as pandas and openpyxl to read in and manipulate the data. 
You can also use regular expressions to search for and match patterns in the data that correspond to 
the various data points you are interested in.

Another approach is to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically identify and 
extract the relevant data points from the various sources. This can involve using techniques such as 
named entity recognition (NER) to identify entities such as "carbon emissions" or "CO2 output", 
and then extracting the relevant values associated with these entities.

1. Identify the relevant data points: Make a list of the data points that you want to include in your summary, 
such as carbon emissions, water usage, or waste disposal.

2. Collect the data: Collect the climate impact data from the various sources and store it in a format
that can be easily read by your program, such as a CSV file.

3. Standardize the data: Map the different names for the same data points to a standardized set of names. 
You can do this manually using a spreadsheet program or programmatically using Python.

4. Combine the data: Use a Python library such as pandas to read in and manipulate the data. 
You can then use the standardized names to combine the data from multiple sources into a single dataset.

5. Create a summary: Use pandas or another library to calculate summary statistics for the various data points, 
such as the total carbon emissions or the average water usage.

6. Write the summary to an Excel file: Use a Python library such as openpyxl to write the summary data to an Excel file.
